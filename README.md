# Use Fields
#### Get ACF fields, but nicely

This implements a slightly simpler interface for collecting ACF fields that will fail nicely (or at least, silently) in the event that ACF does not exist.

It also provides a simple interface for retrieving several fields at once, and returning them as members of an array.

For more information, see the methods.
